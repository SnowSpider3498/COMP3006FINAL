# Kristoffer and Courtnay Final Project Proposal

## Research Question
Do sea temperatures have an effect on tropical storm frequency and severity?

## Datasets
Will utilize tropical storm data from 1851 to 2018 using https://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/archive.

Hadley Center observation datasets that contain sea temperatures (and approximations) from 1850 to 2018: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadsst3/data/download.html
